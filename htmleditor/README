Purpose:
--------
This web application allows you to modify scenes, scene items (events,
conditions, actions) and plugin configurations in an easy manner.
Primary targets are desktop pcs and tablet computers (at least 800px width).

How to run this web application:
--------------------------------
The SceneServer™ is used to retrieve and store configuration documents. Because
a web application can not access a raw socket directly, a websocket is used.
The SceneServer™ and the WebSocketProxy have to be started therefore.
You may either host these static html pages via a html server like apache or
lihttpd and browse to the corresponding address or start the index.html
directly from your filesystem. 

Security:
---------
All traffic to the WebSocketProxy and between the WebSocketProxy and
the SceneServer™ is secured by SSL.
If you additionally use the SessionProxy you have to authentificate first.
