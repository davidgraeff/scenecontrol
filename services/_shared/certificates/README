Description:
------------
This certificate is for tests only! Generate your own certificate for
server <--> service ssl communication with openssl, e.g.:
>> openssl req -x509 -new -out generic.crt -keyout generic.key -days 365

The password for the generic private key is "1234".

If your service does not provide an own certificate, this generic one will
be used for ssl communication with the Core. You are encouraged to provide your own
public certificate+private key pair.
