Purpose:
--------
This directory contains the html5/js application that allows you to edit
the events-conditions-actions correlations in an easy, intuitive manner.
Its primary targets are desktop pcs and tablet computer with at least
800px width.

How to run it:
--------------
On the same pc/server that is running the SceneServerâ„¢ you have to run an application
that is able to serve the json data files as WebDav content. Almost all webserver
software is able to do that. I recommend the lighttpd (http://www.lighttpd.net/)
project. Install and activate the mod_webdav and mod_auth modules. A configuration
file for lighttpd is available in the "lighttpd" directory. In short for an
ubuntu/debian operating system with lighttpd:
  1. Install lighttpd and the neccessary modules [sudo apt-get install lighttpd lighttpd-mod-webdav]
  2. Configure the modules [Within your build directory: sudo make install_lighttpd]
  3. Find out the IP address of your server, I will refer to it as xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
  4. Use the application with your webbrowser. [Navigate to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/sceneeditor]
