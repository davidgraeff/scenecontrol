	Purpose: Database convenience singleton object for
	(1) importing json documents into the database (importFromJSON)
	(1) exporting json documents out of the database (exportAsJSON)
	(1) installing plugin json documents in the database if not already installed (verifyPluginData)
	(2) listening for event document changes (startChangeListenerEvents)
	(2) request for all events of a plugin (requestEvents)
	(3) listening for configuration document changes (startChangeListenerSettings)
	(3) requesting configuration for a plugin (requestPluginSettings)
